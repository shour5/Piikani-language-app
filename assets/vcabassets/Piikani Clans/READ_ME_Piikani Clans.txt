 For the vocabulary, please list in the same order that corresponds with the spereadsheet, including Blackfoot and Phonics.  You'll see 
that there are numbers next to some of these.  Where you see these numbers, ex. (1 Hairy Nose...1 Padded Saddles); this means 
that they are related and are just another name that this clan also had, so please keep the numbering in.
